# MAGIC # LLMs with Hugging Face
# MAGIC In this notebook, we'll take a whirlwind tour of some top applications using Large Language Models (LLMs), as well as several key aspects of the Hugginface Transformers Library. These will include:
# MAGIC * Transformers Models
# MAGIC * Tokenizers
# MAGIC * Pipelines
# MAGIC * Datasets
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Additionally, we log our Transformers pipelines to MLflow see how Databricks MLflow integrates with LLM models out-of-the-box.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC ## Learning Objectives
# MAGIC 1. Understand how to load tokenizers and models from Huggingface using the `transformers` library
# MAGIC 2. Understand how load datasets from Huggingface using the `datasets` library
# MAGIC 3. Log our Transformers pipeline to MLflow with the `mlflow.transformers` library

# MAGIC ## Hugging Face, Transformers Models, and Tokenizers
# MAGIC Let's navigate to [Hugging Face model hub](https://huggingface.co/models) and explore some models that are on the platform. You will see that (most) models come with descriptions of their task, the data that they were trained on, as well as their associated `Tokenizer`
# MAGIC
# MAGIC ### Transformers Models
# MAGIC In the Hugging Face library, a Transformers model refers to a pre-trained model that can be used for a wide range of NLP tasks. These models, like BERT, GPT, or T5, are built using the Transformers architecture and are trained on large datasets, enabling them to understand and generate human language effectively.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC ### Tokenizers
# MAGIC A tokenizer is a critical component that preprocesses text data for the model. Each model in the library usually comes with its associated tokenizer, ensuring compatibility and optimal performance.

# COMMAND ----------

from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForSeq2SeqLM, pipeline
from transformers.utils import logging

# Load model from Hugging Face using the transformers library
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("google/pegasus-xsum")
model = AutoModelForSeq2SeqLM.from_pretrained("google/pegasus-xsum")

# create a transformers pipeline
# to create one, we need to define the following: The type of task, the model, the tokenizer, as well as a few other parameters that we'll discuss below
pipe = pipeline(
  "summarization", model=model, tokenizer=tokenizer, max_new_tokens=1024, device_map='auto', truncation=True
)

# MAGIC ### Create a Model Signature
# MAGIC For LLMs, we need to generate a [model signature](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/models.html#model-signature-and-input-example).
# MAGIC Model signatures show the expected input and output types for a model. Which makes quality assurance for downstream serving easier

# MAGIC ### Create an Experiment and Log our Model
# MAGIC Great! Now that we have our model signature, we want create an experiment and log our model. Typically, we log models after finetuning or packaging with other artifacts (more on that later). But for now, we're just going to do a simple `log_model()`run to explore MLflow's functionality 
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Note that, if not set, MLflow automatically sets the `experiment_name` for all MLflow experiments. However, as best practice, you should always name your experiments and model artifacts for better tracking.
